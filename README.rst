We encourage the NetMRI community to share scripts in this repository.  
All contributions are welcome, e.g. CCS, Perl, Python, external scripts, Policy XML, DSBs
Thanks for your contributions!

Python Examples
---------------

The Python examples use https://github.com/infobloxopen/infoblox-netmri to
interact with the NetMRI.

The scripts will read connection parameters from environment variables.
Change the netmri.env file to contain your connection details, then source it
before running the scripts.

Full NetMRI Python Scripting support is part of NetMRI as of 7.2
