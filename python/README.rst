Python Examples
---------------

The Python examples use https://github.com/infobloxopen/infoblox-netmri to
interact with NetMRI.

The scripts will read connection parameters from environment variables.
Change the netmri.env file to contain your connection details, then source it
before running the scripts.

Full NetMRI Python Scripting support is part of NetMRI as of 7.2
